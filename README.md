# My Dev Landing Page

**Hello World**, 

Welcome to my dev landing page. I borrowed everything from **[Dinesh Pandiyan](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page)**. Some day, I will build my own landing page from scratch, but for now, thanks to him!


## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

*"I wanted a dev landing page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point rather beautiful and hefty. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same."* (Dinesh Pandiyan) 

Indeed we do!

## What I can do 

Not much for now... But I'm 100% sure that things are going to get interesting very fast thanks to my colleagues and coaches at **[BeCode](https://becode.org/)**!

## Languages that I know 

|Language|Proficiency                                             |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| *HTML* | Not to brag, but I got this!                           |
| *CSS*  | I understand how it works but I'm not quite there yet. |
| *JS*   | Still working on the basics...                         |
| *PHP*  | I know how to spell it, but that's about it.           |

I will try not to forget to update this table at somepoint in the future. 

## Projects 

I am currently working on a website for a music school. Thanks to BeCode I hope that I can make it public as soon as possible. 

## Recommendations 

**[OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr)** My go-to website to learn anything code-related. 

**[Twilioquest](https://www.twilio.com/quest)** is a RPG game that gives you the opportunity to practice with a variety of programmation language. I used it to consolidate my learning in JS.
